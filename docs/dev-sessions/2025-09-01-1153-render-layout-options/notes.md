## Session Start: 2025-09-01 11:53

### Current Context
- Working on branch: `render-layout-options`
- Previous session (unfurl-thumbnails) completed successfully with full metadata extraction feature

### Progress Log

**Phase 1: Foundation Setup** ✅
- Replaced "Generated at" paragraph with collapsible options menu

**Phase 3: JavaScript Foundation** ✅

**Phase 4: Card View Polish** ✅

- Enhanced hover effects with transform animations  
- Better mobile responsiveness with larger touch targets
- Fixed final row stretching issues with CSS Grid
- Added proper text wrapping for long titles

**Phase 5: Lightbox Implementation** ✅
- Added `LightboxOverlay` custom element for modal display
- Only activates in card view, graceful fallback in list view
- Proper content cloning and iframe reinitialization
- Mobile-optimized with 95% viewport on small screens
- Prominent close button with 48px touch targets
- Escape key support and click-outside-to-close
- Smooth animations and proper focus management

**Phase 6: Testing and Final Polish** ✅
- All tests pass, code formatted properly
- Final render test successful
- Feature ready for production use

### Decisions Made

**Architecture**: Hybrid custom element approach with main `LayoutController` and specialized `LightboxOverlay`
**View Mode**: Changed from "Grid" to "Card" for better mobile description - single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop
**Persistence**: Single localStorage object `feedspool-layout-preferences` for future extensibility
**Mobile Strategy**: Mobile-first responsive design with larger touch targets (44px+ minimum)
**Lightbox Design**: Only active in card view, prominent close button essential for mobile usability
**Progressive Enhancement**: All functionality works without JavaScript as graceful fallback

### Issues Encountered

**No Major Issues**: Implementation went smoothly following the detailed plan
**Mobile Consideration**: Added explicit close button after realizing click-outside wouldn't work well on mobile with large lightbox
**CSS Grid Mastery**: Successfully avoided flex final-row width issues by using CSS Grid properly

### Final Summary

**Core Functionality**:
- Collapsible options menu in header with gear icon
